                <h3 class="fw-bold">Introduction</h3>
                <p>In recent years, the field of computer science has seen remarkable advancements, yet there remains a glaring gap in the integration of responsible computing principles within modern curricula. Many Computer Science courses overlook ethics and Responsible Computing (RC) concerns, failing to equip students with essential ethical principles. This oversight is critical as Computer Science students must comprehend and apply ethical considerations to make positive contributions to the computing community. To address this challenge, the Mozilla Foundation supported the School of Computer Science and Information Technology at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) to pioneer the development of curricular content focused on Responsible Computing.
                </p>

                <p>The overarching goal of this partnership was to empower computer science students with the knowledge and skills necessary to engage with ethical and Responsible Computing principles effectively. To achieve this goal, the DeKUT RC team embarked on several key objectives:
                <ol>
                    <li>Conducting research to support the seamless integration of responsible computing into computer science education.</li>
                    <li>Developing a Software Ethics Assessment Tool designed to evaluate the integration of ethics into computing curricula comprehensively.</li>
                    <li>Integrating ethics education into one of the existing computer science courses to ensure a holistic approach to ethical learning.</li>
                    <li>Creating a Software Projectsâ€™ Ethics Assessment Tool to assess students' projects against Responsible Computing standards rigorously.</li>
                </ol>

                The team held a second external stakeholders' forum which served as a vital platform to update participants on the project's progress and discuss its impact on students and lecturers. During the forum, key areas of discussion included the successful integration of Responsible Computing principles into the curriculum, the development and demonstration of assessment tools like the Software Ethics Assessment Tool (SEAT), and the overall feedback and experiences from stakeholders.
                </p>
                <p class="fw-bold">During the forum, the agenda covered various essential aspects: </p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">A. Review of project implementation status, with a specific focus on lecturer experiences.</h3>
                <p>Feedback from lecturers who implemented Responsible Computing (RC) concept teaching revealed that the course delivery surpassed project expectations. They attributed this success to the structured framework known as ImpactCS, which delineated five integrated knowledge areas. These areas included the responsibilities of a computer professional, ACM and IEEE code of conduct, and ethical analysis with sample case studies. The utilization of ImpactCS provided a clear roadmap for integrating RC principles into the curriculum effectively. Moreover, the teaching sessions featured two guest speakers who brought real-world perspectives to the classroom. Their presentations showcased practical applications of RC within organizations, offering valuable insights and illustrating the relevance of responsible computing in professional settings. These sessions served to contextualize theoretical concepts and illustrate their real-world relevance, enhancing the learning experience for both students and lecturers. The inclusion of guest speakers facilitated a deeper understanding of how RC principles are applied in professional settings, further reinforcing the importance of integrating ethics into computer science education.

                </p>
                <h3 class="fw-bold">B. The evaluation of the project's impact from the perspective of students and learners revealed a multitude of positive outcomes, both in academic and extracurricular contexts. </h3>
                <p>Students who participated in the project, expressed their appreciation for the project, highlighting how it transformed their understanding and approach to responsible computing. Many students noted that their experience with the project was a significant mindset shift, particularly in terms of algorithm development and considerations of societal impact. They cited examples of how the integration of Responsible Computing (RC) principles, such as transparency, confidentiality, and community engagement, influenced their learning and skill development positively.
                </p>
                <p>Moreover, students benefited from additional activities beyond traditional classroom sessions. They were paired with mentors from the industry, who provided invaluable guidance and insights into industry practices. The mentorship program was highly praised by students, as it both enhanced their industry-specific skills and provided valuable career guidance and direction.</p>
                <p>
                    The project also organized bootcamps, where students had the opportunity to implement RC principles in various software development challenges. This hands-on experience allowed students to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios, further solidifying their understanding of responsible computing principles.
                </p>
                <p> One notable impact of the project was the establishment of the DeKUT Responsible Computing and Ethics Club. This club serves as a platform to nurture and promote responsible computing and ethics among its members. The club's objectives include fostering a culture of responsible computing, developing members into RC ambassadors, and engaging with other related clubs and organizations, such as the Ethics and Integrity Club. The club hosts events like competitions, workshops, and industry linkages, providing members with opportunities for networking, skill development, and knowledge sharing.
