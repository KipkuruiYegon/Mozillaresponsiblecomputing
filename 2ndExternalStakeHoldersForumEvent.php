            The 2<sup>nd</sup> External Stakeholder Forum</h3>
        <p class="fw-bold">Responsible Computing Forum Highlights Progress in Integrating Ethics into Computer Science Education</p>
        <p>A stakeholder forum at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology (DeKUT) discussed progress in integrating Responsible Computing (RC) principles into the computer science curriculum. The project, supported by Mozilla, aimed to equip future computer scientists with the necessary ethical frameworks to navigate complex technological landscapes.</p>
        <h4 class="fw-bold">Key Findings</h4>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Successful Integration:</b> Lecturers reported successful integration of RC concepts using a structured framework called ImpactCS. Guest speakers from industry provided real-world perspectives on applying RC principles.</li>
            <li><b>Positive Student Impact: </b> Students appreciated the project, highlighting a shift in their approach to responsible computing. Mentorship programs, bootcamps, and an RC & Ethics Club fostered a culture of responsible computing.</li>
            <li><b>Software Ethics Assessment Tool (SEAT):</b> Stakeholders reviewed the SEAT, a tool designed to evaluate the integration of ethics into computing curricula. Discussions focused on the tool's potential and areas for improvement, such as a broader range of ethical considerations, alignment with industry standards, and enhanced reporting features.</li>
