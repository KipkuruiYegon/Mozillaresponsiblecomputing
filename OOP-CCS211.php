                            Have students follow the 5-step decision-making process to identify the choice of the problem to undertake, namely: develop a problem statement (gather facts, no assumption, identify stakeholders) Why are we doing this? What’s wrong with the current way? What benefits does this new way offer?
                            Identify alternatives (other ways of solving the same problem informed by stakeholder involvement).
                            <br>
                            Evaluate and choose alternative (justification for the choice of solution).
