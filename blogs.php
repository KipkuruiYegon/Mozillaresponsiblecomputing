                <h2 class="mt-1" style="font-size:25px;">Responsible Computing Overview</h2>

                <p>Responsible computing, also known as ethical computing, refers to the practice of developing,
                    using, and managing computing technologies in a manner that is considerate of the ethical,
                    social, and environmental implications of these technologies. Computers and computer
                    applications have become part of our personal and professional lives, physical infrastructure, and
                    societal fabric. Computer scientists and professionals who design and develop applications carry
                    a significant responsibility because the systems they create can have ....</p>

                <p>Responsible Computing? As we mingled and chimed glasses, during the recent stakeholder
                    workshop on Mozilla Responsible Computing Challenge – Dedan Kimathi University of
                    Technology (DeKUT) Chapter, that question rung through the air. Amidst dissimilar postulations,
                    at least, there was a unanimous supposition that being responsible is a virtue of life that an
                    individual ought to practice right from the early ages of cognitive development. In fact,
                    Erickson’s early theory of human growth and development posit that by the age of 3 years,
                    children start developing a sense of purpose, initiative, guilty and egocentricism that inform their
                    perception of the world...</p>

                <p>
                    Question: How do we determine if a software developed has met the ethical
                    principles?

                    The rapid development of new technologies has raised a number of ethical concerns,
                    such as the potential for these technologies to be used for malicious purposes, to
                    violate privacy, or to create social divides. In order to address these concerns, it is
                    important to develop responsible computing...

                <p>In recent years, IBM has engaged in extensive discussions with numerous Chief Technology
                    Officers (CTOs) across various industries to compile a series of reports known as Architecture
                    Decision Points, that can be tailored for the university context. These reports underscore the
                    growing recognition among academic leaders that technology plays a pivotal role in shaping the
                    future of higher education. However, they are also acutely aware that educational institutions are
                    increasingly expected to align their actions with the values they profess, with technology serving
                    as a key conduit. Moreover, these....</p>

                    reliant on technology, the need for a comprehensive understanding of computing principles is
