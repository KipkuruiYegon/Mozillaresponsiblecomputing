                    <strong class="text-success">Gender and Responsible Artificial Intelligence Network</strong> brings together organizations, universities, and hubs based in sub-Saharan Africa who are either already active or interested in becoming active in the field of AI and/or gender inclusion. The goal is to learn, share, defend, and propose solutions to the cross-cutting issues of AI, gender equality, and development. GRAIN establishes a link between the development of artificial intelligence and gender equality. The field of action is sub-Saharan Africa, with a medium-term focus on gender and inclusion, and in the longer term on equality and the kind.

                <h3>Purpose</h3>
                <p>
                    The GRAIN Network is dedicated to addressing several pivotal objectives:

                    <br><strong>1. Closing the Data Gap:</strong> In sub-Saharan Africa, there is a significant shortage of disaggregated gender data. This scarcity exacerbates disparities in AI assessments and distorts our understanding of societal needs.

                    <br><strong>2. Promoting Women in AI:</strong> We are passionately committed to encouraging more women to pursue careers in AI and rectifying the underrepresentation of women in this field.

                    <br><strong>3. Correcting Algorithmic Biases:</strong> Our belief is that AI should provide solutions to gender-related issues, not exacerbate biases. We actively work to eliminate algorithmic biases introduced by designers.

                    <br><strong>4. Framework Development:</strong> GRAIN is actively engaged in developing frameworks for the responsible use of AI and promoting a better consideration of AI and gender in governance.

                    <br><strong>5. African Context Consideration:</strong> We aim to incorporate African perspectives in AI development, recognizing the unique challenges specific to our contexts.

                    <br><strong>6. Pan-African Collaboration:</strong> GRAIN actively seeks to foster collaboration between French-speaking and English-speaking Africa in the realms of AI and gender inclusion.

                    <br><strong>7. Multidisciplinary Approach:</strong> We acknowledge AI as a multidisciplinary issue and strongly encourage collaboration between gender experts and AI practitioners.

                    Gender is an overarching concern that underpins all our initiatives.

                <p>
                    GRAIN's approach involves creating a collaborative and partnership platform for universities and institutions interested in AI and gender issues. Given the role AI plays in digital and economic development, it is essential to create a network that amplifies women's voices at local and regional levels, identifies their challenges, and offers pragmatic solutions for the responsible use and adoption of AI.

                <h3 class="text-center">Artificial Intelligence for Gender Inclusion & Equality</h3>
                <p>This call was part of the Artificial Intelligence for Development in Africa (AI4D Africa) program, supported by Canada's International Development Research Centre (IDRC) and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). The goal was to develop responsible AI that promoted gender inclusion and addressed biases.</p>
                <p>Several challenges existed in AI, such as disaggregated data, gender gaps in the field, limited research capacity in responsible AI, and interdisciplinary challenges. Solutions in Africa required a multi-African context, given the continent's diversity. The Gender and Responsible AI Network (GRAIN) aimed to collaborate and find solutions for gender inclusion and equity.</p>
                <p>The call invited proposals in three grant categories: Data-driven research, Thematic contribution papers, and Call for prototypes/systems. These proposals emphasized responsible AI and gender inclusion. The call provided detailed information on each category.</p>
                <p>Eligibility criteria included having an organization headquartered in Sub-Saharan Africa, expertise in AI and gender, and the ability to work in English and/or French.</p>
                <p>The deadline for proposal submission was December 11, 2022.</p>

                <p>This project by the DeKUT School of Computing focuses on addressing gender inequality in STEM education in Kenya, particularly the underrepresentation of female students in STEM fields. It examines the factors contributing to this gender disparity in STEM and delves into the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on female students' career placement. The study aims to understand female students' perceptions of AI in STEM programs and explore the ethical implications of AI application, emphasizing gender inclusivity and societal benefits.</p>
                <p><strong>Research objectives</strong> include analyzing trends in female STEM enrollment, investigating the influence of gender inequality on student placement, proposing strategies to enhance AI use among female students, and assessing the ethical purposes and societal benefits of AI. Utilizing a mixed research design, the project collects data from Kenyan educational institutions and industry. The ultimate goal is to develop an analytical model to reduce gender inequality in STEM and encourage female participation in AI, aligning with Kenya's Vision 2030 and the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. The results will be shared through workshops and publications to promote gender equality in STEM and AI fields.</p>
                <p>The project follows ethical guidelines, ensuring data privacy and participant anonymity. By fostering female participation in AI and STEM, it seeks to unlock the potential of STEM education and AI for Kenya's societal progress and economic growth.</p>
                <p>Supported by the DeKUT School of Computing, this project aims to contribute significantly to AI, STEM, and gender equality, addressing a crucial issue with broad implications for Kenya's development and long-term goals.</p>
