        <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify mt-3" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">
          In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, responsible computing stands as the guiding light that illuminates our path through the complex terrain of technology. It is the compass that ensures we navigate the digital frontier with security, ethics, and inclusivity at the forefront. Responsible computing is our commitment to harnessing the incredible power of technology while being mindful of the profound impact it has on individuals, communities, and the world as a whole. It's about recognizing that every line of code, every algorithm, and every innovation carries with it a responsibility to safeguard privacy, uphold ethics, and promote inclusivity.

          Our mission is to integrate ethics and responsible computing principles into education, research, and industry practices. We strive to empower the next generation of computer scientists with the knowledge and skills to make ethical decisions, protect privacy, and create technology that benefits everyone.

      <h2 class="text-center fw-bold" style="font-family:">Why Responsible Computing ?</h2>
      <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify mt-3" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">

        Responsible computing goes beyond mere functionality; it champions the cause of creating a digital world where trust, fairness, and accessibility are fundamental pillars. It's a dedication to ensuring that our innovations uplift rather than harm, protect rather than intrude, and include rather than exclude. In an age where technology permeates every aspect of our lives, responsible computing is our moral compass, guiding us to a future where the digital landscape is not only advanced but also just, secure, and equitable. It is a commitment to building a digital world that benefits all, leaving no one behind, and ensuring that technology is a force for good in our interconnected global community.</p>

            Over the years, computer science studies have advanced significantly. However, there appears to be a significant void in the inclusivity of responsible computing principles in modern-day courses. Today, most computer science courses do not consider ethics or responsible computing concerns when teaching students. But, like other disciplines, computer science students ought to learn and adhere to the fundamental ethical and responsible computing principles for a better computing community. Thus, we must find a pathway to integrate responsible computing from our lecture halls into society.
          </p>

          <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">
            To address the above challenge, Mozilla Foundation, through the Responsible Computing Challenge, announced a call to award ten grants from a pool of $250,000 to innovation hubs and accredited Universities in Kenya that integrate ethics into their computer science curricula. The challenge promotes the conception, development, and piloting of computer science curricula content that enables lecturers and students to consider the impact of responsible computing in society.
          </p>

          <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">
            The School of Computer Science and Information Technology in DeKUT submitted and competitively won a grant proposal titled: “Mainstreaming Ethics Risk in Computer Programming,” which sought to integrate ethics and responsible computing in teaching Object-Oriented Programming among second-year computing students, with students implementing the ethical principles in an end-of-course project.” The project aims to provide an opportunity for computer science students to learn and adhere to the fundamental principles of ethical and responsible computing to contribute towards a responsible computing community.
          </p>

          <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">
            The team seeks to achieve the following:
          </p>

          <ul class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style=" font-size: large;">
            <li class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style=" font-size: large;">Conduct research and contribute towards the Mozilla Foundation objective of mainstreaming responsible computing in teaching computer science courses;</li>
            <li class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style=" font-size: large;">Develop an Ethics Assessment Tool that can be used to assess the extent of ethics and responsible computing integration in computing curricula;</li>
            <li class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style=" font-size: large;">Mainstream ethics teaching in one of the Computer Science course in the current curriculum, i.e., CCS 2211: Object Oriented Programming unit; and</li>
            <li class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style="font-size: large;">To develop a Software Projects’ Ethics Assessment Tool, that can be used to evaluate if a program designed by students meets the responsible computing threshold.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">
            It provides an opportunity for computer science students to learn and adhere to the fundamental ethical and responsible computing principles and consider the social impacts for a better computing community.
          </p>

          <p class="lead fw-medium text-justify" style="font-family:; font-size: large;">
            The team takes pride in advancing the DeKUT University motto, “Better Life through Technology,” as premised on this project.
