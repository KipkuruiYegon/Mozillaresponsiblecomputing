        <p class="text-justify">
          In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, responsible computing stands as the guiding light that illuminates our path through the complex terrain of technology. It is the compass that ensures we navigate the digital frontier with security, ethics, and inclusivity at the forefront. Responsible computing is our commitment to harnessing the incredible power of technology while being mindful of the profound impact it has on individuals, communities, and the world as a whole. It's about recognizing that every line of code, every algorithm, and every innovation carries with it a responsibility to safeguard privacy, uphold ethics, and promote inclusivity.

          Responsible computing goes beyond mere functionality; it champions the cause of creating a digital world where trust, fairness, and accessibility are fundamental pillars. It's a dedication to ensuring that our innovations uplift rather than harm, protect rather than intrude, and include rather than exclude. In an age where technology permeates every aspect of our lives, responsible computing is our moral compass, guiding us to a future where the digital landscape is not only advanced but also just, secure, and equitable. It is a commitment to building a digital world that benefits all, leaving no one behind, and ensuring that technology is a force for good in our interconnected global community.

          <p class="">
            Over the years, computer science studies have advanced significantly. However, there appears to be a significant void in the inclusivity of responsible computing principles in modern-day courses. Today, most computer science courses do not consider ethics or responsible computing concerns when teaching students. But, like other disciplines, computer science students ought to learn and adhere to the fundamental ethical and responsible computing principles for a better computing community. Thus, we must find a pathway to integrate responsible computing from our lecture halls into society.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            To address the above challenge, Mozilla Foundation, through the Responsible Computing Challenge, announced a call to award ten grants from a pool of $250,000 to innovation hubs and accredited Universities in Kenya that integrate ethics into their computer science curricula. The challenge promotes the conception, development, and piloting of computer science curricula content that enables lecturers and students to consider the impact of responsible computing in society.
