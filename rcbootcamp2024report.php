                <h3 class="mt-3 mb-3">Mastering OOP Design Principles(OOP) and Responsible Computing(RC)</h3>
                <p class="fw-bold"> <u>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</u></p>
                <p>In the two Bootcamps hosted by the School of Computer Science and IT at Dedan Kimathi University of Technology on Responsible Computing, 71 students engaged in a dynamic learning experience facilitated by a collaborative effort between six staff members, including two from the ICT directorate and four faculty members who are also part of the DeKUT RC Challenge sponsored by Mozilla. The event showcased a total of 13 groups, each contributing to an environment rich in innovation, knowledge sharing, and Responsible Computing & Ethics. Students developed technical solutions and gained practical experience in integrating responsible computing into an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) challenge using Java, considering Responsible Computing and Ethics concepts. Instructors played a vital role in guiding students, ensuring they stayed on the right track, and addressing any concerns they encountered. With a focus on responsible computing principles and ethics, the bootcamps served as platforms for technical skill development, emphasizing the importance of responsible and ethical practices in the field. The combination of collaborative learning, project showcases, and mentorship provided a holistic learning experience for the participants, preparing them for future challenges in the rapidly evolving landscape of Computing. The success of these events highlights the commitment of our academic community to fostering innovation, collaboration, and Responsible Computing principles among our students.</p>
