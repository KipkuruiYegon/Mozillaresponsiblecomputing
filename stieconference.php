            <p>STI&E was started in 2014 to provide researchers from local and international institutions, a forum to discuss and share ideas on the latest innovations and research outputs that address local and global challenges and those that improve the quality of life for the people and inform the decision-making process in matters of development by government and businesses. International delegates came from countries such as Germany and Japan.</p>
            <p>The University has been holding the conference annually in the month of November ever since. The conference was not held in the years 2020 and 2021 owing to the Covid-19 pandemic that the world was facing.</p>
